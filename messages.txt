Welcome, %s. Before you lies a great maze.
You connection to this world is tenuous, and you will have only 100 steps to
reach the goal. You may need to rely on others to complete your jounery.

Now, may I ask what your profession is?

(Type 1 - 7 to select one of the following)
  1 - SCOUTER
  2 - SENSER
  3 - SIGNALLER
  4 - SIGNER
  5 - SIMPLETON
  6 - SMELLER
  7 - SOUNDER



SCOUTER

Faster and more energetic than the others. A scouter can move 200 spaces
instead of 100. Others may find this constant energy annoying.



SENSER

In tune with an innate location sense. A senser always knows their exact grid
location. This sense makes up for a permanent blindness.



SIGNALLER

Just a person with a compass.



SIGNER

Posesses a magical marking skill. A signer can leave up to 5 magic signs, each
with a short message.



SIMPLETON

Just a person.



SNIFFER

A dog. A sniffer has a powerful sense of smell that can tell when the exit is
close. Can be heard from further away by barking, but can not speak.



SOUNDER

Has a fine sense of hearing. A sounder can sing in any direction, and tell how
far away the nearest wall is. Can also find dead ends by listening for echoes.
