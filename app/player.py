# Signaller: knows direction to exit (has a compass)
# Sounder: knows distance to wall, if direction leads to dead end (echoes)
# Scouter: has higher move limit, speaks in all caps
# Senser: knows grid coordinates, blind
# Sniffer: knows logarithmic distance to exit (smell strength), can't speak (is a dog)
# Signer: can leave a few messages
# Simpleton: No abilities
